Welcome to the Github Project for the as-of-yet named Horror Zine project. Members of the team are encouraged to participate in as many roles as they choose. So far, we are in need of writers, editors, community managers, graphic designers, programmers, and morale support.

## Project Details
The Horror Zine will be a monthly publication which features approximately 3 Horror flash fiction stories. Flash fiction, by definition, is a story that is 1000 words or less. The entries would cover a wide range of horror-related themes.

The plan right now is to publish the zine as a hard copy, although there has been discussion about publishing it electronically too. A website has been launched at http://horrorzine.gazerbeam.com where information and the stories could live. The name and the URL are temporary while we decide on a title for the zine.

The first issue of the zine is planned for October 2018.

## Operations

The zine is being managed by a group of volunteer who have assembled inside a Discord server. Anybody is welcome to join at https://discord.gg/7mhP6Bk. You can also join from the homepage of the website.

Ideas, questions, or issues can be posted for discussion inside the discord channels. A list of todos has been started inside the Github project under the "Issues" tab.
